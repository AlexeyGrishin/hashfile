Operates with name-based storage stored in single file specified as first argument. Running without args shows this help.


<options>

Examples
---------------
> java -jar hashfile.jar new_db
> java -jar hashfile.jar new_db --import-from data.txt
> java -jar hashfile.jar new_db --import-from data2.txt --key hello
> java -jar hashfile.jar new_db --export-to copy.txt --key data.txt
> java -jar hashfile.jar new_db --delete --key hello --optimize
> java -jar hashfile.jar new_db --list

Notes
----------------
* Keys are case-sensitive
* Keys are theoretically unlimited
* It is possible to import the whole folder (--import-from=<folder-path>), but there is no way for batch export or
  delete
* Deletion does not reduces file size in order to avoid fragmentation. After many removes it is a good idea
  to reorganize file using --optimize option.
  Note that --optimize option could be used together with other operations
* Default block-size of storage file is 1M, it means that for each entry at least 1M block is allocated even
  if data is small. If you have a lot of small files to import then storage file will grow very fast. To resolve
  it create another db with smaller blocksize (see next section) and copy data there with --copy-from option.
  Example:

  java -jar hashfile.jar new_db --new block=4,truncate=trailing
  java -jar hashfile.jar new_db --copy-from old_db

Creation
----------------
When creating new storage with --new you may specify the following options separated by comma:

  block=<size>          Defines the data block size, in KB. Select it closer to the average data size.
                        Default is 4 ( == 4KB)
  cache=<size>          Defines cache size, in MB.
                        Larger means faster operations, smaller means smaller memory usage.
                        Default is 64 ( == 64MB)
  truncate=<method>     For long keys storage first compares some limited parts of key - first or last N characters.
                        This method defines which characters will be used. Possible values are:
                        * leading - to get first characters. Good for names.
                        * trailing - to get last characters. Good for long paths or URLs.
                        Default is leading.
